# Getting set up

###Installing Python 3.6
Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

###Package Managers- Gotta have 'em!
You can use either pip or anaconda, the [choice](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20994716/what-is-the-difference-between-pip-and-conda) is yours! 
####Pip
Python 3.6 comes with pip (handy)
####Anaconda
[Install it](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) (skip the cloud version)

###Troubleshooting your installs- here's how to handle a common problem we saw
Open your terminal (mac), cmd, or powershell (windows). Test that python is installed by entering the command `python3`. The Python 'REPL' should open in your shell. 

If it doesn't, and you get an error, you may need to add Python3.6 to your 'path'. [Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4621255/how-do-i-run-a-python-program-in-the-command-prompt-in-windows-7/4621277#4621277) is a great stackoverflow explaining how to do this. 

If you are using pip, you will want to test it too. Enter `pip install numpy` in your shell. If you get an error, you will need to add pip itself to your path as well, just like you did for python3.6.

###What's an IDE?
"Integrated development environment"- no one calls them this. Basically, it's where you write your python code. [Here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) is some info on the various IDEs available to you. My advice is to start with Jupyter because it's easy to use, easy to see your work as you work, and it's what the EdX course will be using. [Here](https://github.com/codergirlhailz/jupyter) are my notes are getting started with Jupyter. 

I also recommend PyCharm or Atom if you are interested in playing around with other IDEs.
